this code take hugging face "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model to embed the data and used atlas vector search and used the same hugging face model to search through it .
as of database i used mongodb. and i used sample file which is enough it has more than 20000 movies with plot,genres etc.
but due to compute power i only embedded first 50 but if u have enough i can alter the code by taking the limit function
